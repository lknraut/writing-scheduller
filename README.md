	<h1>Simple Writing Scheduler</h1>
	<p>The simple  Writing Scheduler is a Python program that helps users schedule their writing assignments based on a fixed writing schedule. Users can input the start date, end date, and their writing schedule (i.e. the number of pages they can write each day), and the program will calculate the expected page numbers for each day.

The Writing Scheduler is useful for writers who want to plan their writing assignments in advance and ensure that they stay on track with their writing goals. It can also be used by teams of writers who are working on a collaborative writing project, as the program can allocate tasks based on the expected page numbers for each day.</p>
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>The motivation for creating the Writing Scheduler was to provide a simple and flexible tool that writers can use to plan their writing assignments. Many writers struggle with procrastination and lack of motivation, and having a clear plan for their writing assignments can help them stay on track and make progress towards their writing goals.</p>
	<h2>How to Use</h2>
	<p>To use the Writing Scheduler, simply run the program and follow the prompts to input the start date, end date, and writing schedule. The program will then calculate the expected page numbers for each day and display them on the screen.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, you can also use the program in a loop to schedule multiple assignments at once</p>
